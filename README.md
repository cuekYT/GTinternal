# GrowtopiaInternal
A growtopia C++ internal cheat with enough features to avoid the need of purchasing one.
This internal has enough features, it is useless and completely visual to spend money for one.

# Features
- AAP Bypass, full login data spoofer in code
- Sending packets, getting peer address etc.
- Doing any function calls
- SendPacketRaw and SendPacket
- Detouring any functions
- Receiving string and raw packets.
- Command line starts up after injection, but can easily be combined with ImGui and other stuff, it is freely editable and thats what makes this internal more powerful than any internal you would purchase.

UPDATE: Addresses updated to 3.37! You can now use the internal straight with latest version of Growtopia

[NOTE: 3.38 released, but you can still use 3.37 with version bypass (just edit the game_version value to the latest version in source code) (UPDATE: it's being spoofed to "4.20" already, so you should have no problems at injecting this to a 3.37 growtopia client and still being able to play in servers)
